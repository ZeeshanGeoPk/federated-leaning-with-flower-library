# Federated Leaning with Flower library
In this repository we have given the demo of Federated Learning using Flower library. There is a server.py file acting like a Centralized server and there are two clients called client1 and client2 with named client1.py and client2.py respectively. You need to run the server.py first and then initialize the clients.
